[#removed-keycloak]
= Remove `keycloak-js` from your application

The `keycloak-js` dependency in `@onecx/angular-auth` has been marked as *optional*.  
This means:

* The Onecx Shell application *still requires* `keycloak-js`.
* Other applications *should remove it* unless they directly use Keycloak inside the app.

== Uninstall `keycloak-js`
Run the following command in your application project:

[source,bash]
----
npm uninstall keycloak-js
----

== Verify That Your App Works Without `keycloak-js`

After uninstalling, check whether your app throws the following error in the browser console:

[source,console]
----
Keycloak initialization failed! Could not load keycloak-js library which is required in the current environment.
----

If you see this error, your application **still needs `keycloak-js`**, and you must reinstall it.

= Upgrade NX Application to Angular 20

This guide describes how to upgrade an NX-based OneCX application to Angular 20. Complete the pre-migration steps from the main migration guide before you continue.

== Update NX Packages

Update the Angular and NX packages in your workspace by running:

[source, bash]
----
nx migrate 22.3.0 --interactive
----

This command prompts you to apply updates for each major version of Angular and TypeScript. Apply all proposed updates up to Angular 20.3 and TypeScript 5.9.

For details on NX / Angular compatibility, refer to the xref:https://nx.dev/docs/technologies/angular/guides/angular-nx-version-matrix[Angular NX Version Matrix].

For details on `nx migrate`, refer to the official documentation: xref:https://nx.dev/docs/guides/tips-n-tricks/advanced-update[NX Migrate Documentation].

== Update Package Versions in package.json

1. After running the migration command, update the remaining packages manually. Update all `@onecx/*` packages to version `^7.0.0`.

2. Update the packages listed here to the specified versions: xref:./update-v7-packages.adoc[Required Package Updates].

3. After updating `package.json`, run `npm install` to install the new versions. If you see peer dependency errors, update the affected packages to compatible versions.

[NOTE]
==== 
If you still see dependency conflicts that reference old versions, reinstall dependencies from scratch:

[source, bash]
----
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .angular dist ~/.angular/cache && npm cache clean --force && npm install
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to migrate the updated packages and resolve any breaking changes. Refer to the official documentation of each package for migration guides and instructions.
====

== Run NX Migration
After updating the package versions, run the following command to apply the generated migrations:

[source, bash]
----
nx migrate --run-migrations
----

After this step, proceed with the remaining post-migration steps.
